  	      Hadn't seen it put that way before: #procrastination is when your present self rebels against your past self at the expense of your future self. That's a great way to see it! <a href="https://x.com/WorkFlowy/status/1399365117268185090">https://x.com/WorkFlowy/status/1399365117268185090</a>

  	      I still remember the @notsmartblog article from over a decade ago that made me realize that procrastination is a life-long fight: "In the struggle between should versus want, you need to understand something crucial – want never goes away." — <a href="https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/10/27/procrastination/">https://youarenotsosmart.com/2010/10/27/procrastination/</a>

  	      In that light, it's not surprising that of all the strategies I've used over the years (bullet journals, calendars, agendas, todo lists, kanban boards, inbox filters, notification blockers, etc.) none of them is a magic bullet that keeps procrastinating impulses permanently away.

  	      I still use most of those tools and strategies, mind you; and they are an invaluable help. But the only thing that saves me when they invariably fail every now and then, is the trusty #pomodoro method. There are times where only choice is to power through the initial discomfort.
