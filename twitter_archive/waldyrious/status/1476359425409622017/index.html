  	      What's more, they then took up an interesting angle with the new Matrix being based on a strategy of keeping humans entertained by fictions, engaging their feelings and desires, with little connection to actual facts and consequences — but never argued for this convincingly (2/N)

  	      I'm not talking about making an explicit connection to fake news — that much is obvious. But they could have e.g. picked up @harari_yuval's argument of humankind's most important constructs being fictional, or even better, @JohnDanaher's description of the "virtual utopia" (3/N)

  	      But even if they didn't satisfy the "pop philosophy" angle  of the original trilogy, they could at least have innovated in the effects. But they just doubled down on those from the previous films, and the initial meta commentary calling that out makes it even worse. (4/N)

  	      In the end, the only innovative part (in the context of the Matrix universe) was the human-machine collaboration. Unfortunately it was shown only superficially. All in all, it's a decent film, but doesn't stand up to the original trilogy. (5/5)
