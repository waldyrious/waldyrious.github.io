  	      I've been reading the extensive Wikipedia article on ancient Athenian democracy, and although a complex and nuanced topic, it's a fascinating read. It's crazy how many of their structures and processes would be innovative even in modern society.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy</a> 1/3

  	      For instance, the once-per-lifetime role limits, the fast judicial process, the open-to-all-citizens assembly, the random selection by sortition, the boule executive being limited to executing the decisions of the assembly (with much less leeway than today's governments), etc 2/3

  	      Of course it wasn't all roses: only adult male Athenians could be citizens (so much for women and immigrants), the availability for political involvement rested on widespread slavery, etc. But we could certainly recover some of the good parts.
