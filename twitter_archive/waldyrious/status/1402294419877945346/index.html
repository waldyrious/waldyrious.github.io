  	      1/ I think I finally understood what the latest Wikimedia project, Abstract Wikipedia, is about! The crucial part was described from 10:35 to 16:45. <a href="https://x.com/vrandezo/status/1400526156244398083">https://x.com/vrandezo/status/1400526156244398083</a>

  	      Here's my attempt at summarizing it:<br>— Semantic triples cannot capture narrative content (time-ordered events), but natural language can<br>— Abstract Wikipedia aims to represent natural language content in a language-neutral way<br>— It's not aiming to represent semantics, just syntax

  	      Outliners are great at representing the hierarchical nature of human thought (esp. the ladder of abstraction where more complex concepts build upon simpler ones), but they're cumbersome to represent content that has inherent order due to temporal or causal relationships.

  	      Looking forward to see the field of knowledge representation evolve as we address these challenges! I'm hoping (maybe naively) that the resulting representation will retain some transparency to humans, and not be some opaque machine learning model like those of GPT-3 and friends!
