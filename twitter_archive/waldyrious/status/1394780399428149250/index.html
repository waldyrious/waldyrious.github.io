  	      Stoked to see one of my favorite apps double down on providing a stellar user experience. IMO the outliner content model (infinitely nestable bullet lists) has a potential and versatility that is yet to be fully realized. I can't wait to see what is coming next for Workflowy! <a href="https://x.com/WorkFlowy/status/1394623930099552256">https://x.com/WorkFlowy/status/1394623930099552256</a>

  	      I love this passage from their post: "Make the features you have as powerful as possible, and then make sure they combine synergistically." — reminds me of git's prolific usage of the content-addressed graph model, and the Unix philosophy of small, composable tools.
